What is this I don't even
-------------------------
Blablabla, this is the repository for an Anchor CMS theme that is to conform to my every irrational whim.

Here's a list of stuff that still needs doing:
----------------------------------------------
+  Find nice colours and fonts for day mode and night mode.
+  Implement the two colour-schemes (day and night) and add a toggle button.
+  Style the post entries on the main page
+  Style the post entries on the individual pages
+  Style the comment section
+  Make a menu with a search bar, tag filter and link to the about page.
+  Find a nice license for the content and add it to the footer.
+  Make sure the site displays well on small screens.
+  Add a custom field for the short post description.
+  Add indicators to the bottom of main page post entries (number of characters, tags, comments)
